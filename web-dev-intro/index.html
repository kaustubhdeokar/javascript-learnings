            First step, it goes through a filter (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter by default).
            - verifies if the user credentials are correct. (Authentication happens here).
            - it returns an object of class Authentication. 
            - The Authentication Manager implements a method authenticate which takes in the above object and passes to an implementation of the Authentication Provider (like DaoAuthenticationProvider) 
            - The Authentication Manager figures out who all are the authentication providers available. By default the authentication manager is the ProviderManager.

            Code component - set of code executes line by line.
